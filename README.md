# Julia for Machine Learning

## Advantages:

## Speed and compilation

The main advantage of Julia over other Machine Learning languages is speed. Two main reasons for Juliaâ€™s speed advantage are, firstly, that it is a compiled language. Secondly, it has been designed for parallelism.

## Script-like Syntax

Despite the speed advantage, Julia's syntax is not very complicated. It feels much like a scripting language and it is relatively easy to switch to Julia from a Python or R background.
